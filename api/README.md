# GeoData ingestion and conversion services

`geodata-upload` validates a WebGIS JWT through its JWKS, requires an admin
role, streams `PUT /api/geodata/v1/uploads` requests to the private
`geodata-raw` bucket, and writes user-supplied catalog metadata to the dedicated
GeoData PostgreSQL database. It never returns the bucket, S3 endpoint, object
key, or S3 credentials.

`POST /api/geodata/v1/jobs` accepts a catalog `rawUploadId`, a zoom range and an
optional layer name. It queues work without exposing raw storage paths.
`geodata-worker` atomically claims each queued job, downloads the private source,
converts it to MBTiles, writes it to `geodata-derived`, then records the internal
artifact key and final status. It uses Tilemaker's built-in
OpenMapTiles-compatible schema for OSM PBF and GDAL for the other supported
formats.

Required settings are documented in `deployment/README.md`. The service fails
closed if the WebGIS JWKS URL, issuer, or audience are missing. Confirm the
issuer/JWKS/audience values against the existing WebGIS token before deploying;
the UI's TypeScript auth response alone does not define those JWT claims.
